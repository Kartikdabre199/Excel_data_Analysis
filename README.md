# Excel_data_Analysis
This repository contains a collection of Excel dashboards that I created while learning about Excel.
The dashboards include pivot tables, various visuals like graphs and charts, and interactive elements.

# Dashboard Examples
* ### Customer Expenditure and spending analysis in the mall using excel:
 * Objective :-  On which range of customer we should spend more so that we will get more profit .
 * Data:- Total 200 customers Female 112 and male 88
 * Age wise Gender Calculation:- In 28-38 age group female and male count more. Next 18-27,38-47,48-57,58-67,68-77(Desc)
 * Outlier Calculation:- "In annual income only 1 data point present as outlier  so we can ignore this outlier.
                         From Correlation table got to know age ,income and spending score are independent to eachother."
 * Annual Incomewise Spending Score:-"28-37 age grp number of male/female count ,avg income and avg spending score more.
                         other than 28-37 age grp,avg expenditure more for 18-27 and 68-77 grp 
                         but we can see count of male/female is very less in 68-77 grp .so from 68-77 grp from 
                         less ppl we are getting more profit ."
* ### E-Commerce product sales analysis: 
 Shows total sales and units sold for key American retailers, with monthly sales and filtering by sales period.
